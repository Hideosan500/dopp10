\section*{Questions we plan to answer}

	\subsection*{How has the use of nuclear energy evolved over time?}
	First we want to use descriptive statistics to describe the nuclear energy usage (creation/consumption) of countries over the years. We want to see if there is a correlation between energy imports/exports. We also want to find out if/how policies, treaties, agreements changed the usage (nuclear phaseout after Fukushima 2011, Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement, ...)
	
	\subsection*{How well does the use of nuclear energy correlate with changes in carbon emissions?}
	We want to compare the total/relative nuclear energy creation of a country against its carbon emissions. Maybe we need to normalize the data per capita.  A possible exploration would be if countries with nuclear power plants generate less electricity via renewable energy sources? 
	
	\subsection*{ Are there characteristics of a country that correlate with increases or decreases in the use of nuclear energy?}

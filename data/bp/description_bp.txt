- complex xls, many workbooks, but also csv available
- all main countries available, but often aggregations used for smaller (not significant) countries
like: "Other South America"
+ time range variable (not consistent ranges) mostly 1965-2019
+ figures in exajoules
+ dimensions

attributes (columns) used from csv

name -> description

co2_mtco2 -> carbon dioxide emissions in mt
-- coalcons_ej -> coal consumption in ej
++ coalprod_ej -> coal production in ej
-- gascons_ej -> gas consumption in ej
++ gasprod_ej -> gas production in ej
+- hydro_ej -> hydroelectricity production (= consumption) in ej
+- nuclear_ej -> nuclear energy production (= consumption) in ej
-- oilcons_ej -> oil consumption in ej
++ oilprod_mt -> oil production in mt (to be transformed in exajoule)
+- renewables_ej -> renewable energy production (= consumption) in ej
calculated
-- primary_cons_ej (all consumption values)
++ primary_prod_ej (all production values)

1 exajoule = 1 quintillion joules = 0.948 quadrillion btu
1 million tonne of oil = 39.683 trillion btu = 0.039683 quadrillion btu = 0.0418597 exajoule

ej ... exajule
mt ... million tonnes
renewables, hydro, nuclear ... consumption based on generation not accounting cross-border electricity supply

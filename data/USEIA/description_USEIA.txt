+ more simple csv (split among various files possible)
+ granularity: country iso codes (no aggregations)
+ time range consistent 1980-2018
+ figures in quadrillion btu (british thermal unit) = 10^15 ("in Billiarden")
+ dimensions
-- consumption
-- coal
-- natural gas
-- petroleum and other liquids
-- nuclear
-- renewables and other

++ production
++ coal
++ natural gas
++ petroleum and other liquids
++ nuclear
++ renewables and other

REMARK: use either bp or useia
Decision: continue with USEIA -> load_energy2_data.py
Merging is not recommended due to following differences
- figures are slightly different, reason is not clear, different measures (btu vs joule) have been considered
- breakdown into types of energy also different

Q1: **How has the use of nuclear energy evolved over time? **
	- search for data for production of nuclear energy and consumption (electricity vs. total energy)
	- differences between countries where electricity is produced and consumed (import/export of electricity)
	- Are changes in the amount of produced nuclear energy mainly caused by the building/decommissioning of reactors (or also by varying workload)? 
		--> traditionally the basic level of electric energy supply is provided by nuclear power plants and the peaks are produced by natural gas
	- Change of nuclear energy use due to Global Warming policies/ treaties/ agreements (e.g. of big carbon emitters; Paris Agreement, etc.), past natural disasters (causing nucelar meltdowns),  alternatives in electricity generation (renewable energy).


Q2: How well does the use of nuclear energy correlate with changes in carbon emissions? 
	- necessity to correct for other influences (change in power consumption, constitution of energy sources etc.)
	- interesting question: how does the advancement in power plant technologies (nuclear and other) change the amount of emitted carbon? 
	- Do countries with nuclear power plants generate less electricity via renewable energy sources? 


Q3: Are there characteristics of a country that correlate with increases or decreases in the use of nuclear energy?
	- economic growth? (GDP, developing economies/ countries, i.e. high/ low income countries)
	- possession of nuclear weapons? (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons)
	- availability and operation of other energy sources in the country (e.g. geographic features like mountains, big rivers, intensity of solar radiation, coal and petrol deposits)
		e.g. coal deposits in Poland, hydro power plants in Austria due to mountains...
	- Fukushima 2011 and political reasons?

plot0 - stackplot
Shows overall development of energy production over time in quadrillion
btu. In the selected timeframe (past 38 years) the overall energy
requirements almost doubled. Annual production of all types of energy climbed.
oil +46%, coal +239%, gas +279%, nuclear +384%, renewables + 340%
(1980 vs 2018)

btu ... "defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature
of one pound of water by one degree"


plot1 - 100% stacked area chart
The stacked area chart is focusing on the composition (by energy source).
In 1980 we see about 90% fossil energy sources, 3% nuclear and 7% renewables.
Whereas in 2018 fossil energy sources drop to 84%, nuclear 4.4% and
renewables 11.4%


plot2 - line plot with annotations
Shows energy production per energy source including reported number of deaths from accidents
in nuclear power plants.
Annual increase in average (1980-2018)
+3,7% nuclear production and +3,2% renewables / others
However since 2000, nuclear energy production started to stagnate.
But production of renewables doubled (from 32.1 to 68.35 quadrillion btu)
Remark coal production:
The reason of the climb and the shape of the curve is due to the rapid growth in China,
which is predominant on the coal market.


plot3 - bar plot with data table attached
USA and France are leading the ranking in 1998 as well as 2018.
China catched up and is now #3
The top 7 countries increased production in selected timeframe.
Further observations:
EU countries decrease production and a reduce number of operating reactors.
Japan reduced production and number of reactors significantly, obviously driven by recent accidents.
In the Ukraine the development stagnates. No decline due to Chernobyl disaster in 1986.

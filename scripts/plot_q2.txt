corr_matrix: Heat map
Visualization of correlations between data from energy production/ consumption and CO2 emission due to the enrgy sector.
The focus here lies on correlation between nuclear energy production and CO2 emission due to electricity/ heat
generation.

plot_pie: Pie chart
Gives an overview of the individual CO2 emission contributors when talking about the energy sector - also shows that
electricity/ heat generation only contributes to around half (47%) of total CO2 emissions in this sector.

plot1_world_abs: Absolute values - world
Absolute values of the 3 methods of energy (electricity) production compared to CO2 emissions per year. As can be seen
fossil fuel energy production correlates very well with CO2 emission in the electricity/ heat sector, since energy
production by renewables or through nuclear fission generate only a very small amount of CO2 emissions compared to
fossil fuel energy production.

plot2_world_rel: Relative values - world
Annual electricity/ heat generation global CO2 emissions are plotted in comparison to the three main electricity
production types relative to the year 2010. Some notable historic events have been annotated to the nuclear energy
line to allow possible interpretation of its behaviour. It is apparent that the nuclear disaster in Fukushima had a
palpable impact on future worldwide nuclear energy production, however energy-related CO2 emission does not seem to
have been impacted in the same way. This can be explained that energy production by fossil fuel combustion still grew
over the years following the catastrophic event in Japan, which is the main reason for CO2 emissions in this sector.

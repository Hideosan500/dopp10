corr_matrix: Heat map
Visualization of correlations between data from energy production/ consumption and CO2 emission in the energy sector.
The focus here lies on correlation between nuclear energy production and CO2 emission due to electricity/ heat
generation.

plot_pie: Pie chart
Gives an overview of the individual CO2 emission contributors when talking about the energy sector - also shows that
electricity/ heat generation contributes to around half (47%) of total CO2 emissions in this sector with energy
production by fossil fuel combustion being the main contributor.

plot1_world_abs: Absolute values - World
Absolute values of the 3 methods of energy (electricity) production (see Josef's part - q1) compared to CO2 emissions per year. As can be seen
fossil fuel energy production correlates very well with CO2 emission in the electricity/ heat sector, since energy
production by renewables or through nuclear fission generate only a very small indirect amount of CO2 emissions compared
to fossil fuel energy production.

plot2_world_rel: Relative to year 2010 - World
Annual electricity/ heat generation global CO2 emissions are plotted in comparison to energy production by fossil fuels
and nuclear fission relative to the year 2010. Some notable historic events have been annotated to the nuclear energy
line to allow possible interpretation of its trend. It is apparent that the nuclear disaster in Fukushima had a
palpable impact on future worldwide nuclear energy production, however energy-related CO2 emissions do not seem to
have been impacted in the same way. This can be explained that energy production by fossil fuel combustion still grew
over the years following the catastrophic event in Japan, which is the main reason for CO2 emissions in this sector. It
can be seen that the financial crisis in 2008 had a significant impact on both CO2 emissions as well as energy
production (causation: lower energy production by fossil fuels means lower CO2 emissions in the energy sector).

plot3_jpn_abs: Absolute values - Japan
Annual electricity/ heat generation CO2 emissions are plotted in comparison to energy production by fossil fuels
and nuclear fission in Japan. After the nuclear reactor accident in 2011 nuclear energy production reduced greatly
(2014 even producing zero electricity by nuclear energy). Due to this immense drop CO2 emissions peaked at around 2013,
since fossil fuel electricity generation has not been impacted negligibly by the nuclear disaster.
